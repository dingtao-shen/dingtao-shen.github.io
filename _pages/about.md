I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (IIP), at the Division of Emerging Interdsciplinary Areas (EMIA), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My primary supervisor is [Dr. Wei Su](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=wei-su-weisu), and my co-supervisor is [Dr. Yanguang Zhou](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/yanguang-zhou).

My current research focuses on high-fidelity solution methods for Boltzmann transport equation-based modelling of phonon heat conduction, in [Dr. SU's Research Group](https://weisu-mae.github.io/). My general research interests lie in applied mathematics involving: scientific computing, high-performance computing, uncertainty quantification, machine learning, etc.
