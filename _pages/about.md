I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (IIP), at the Division of Emerging Interdsciplinary Areas (EMIA), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My primary supervisor is [Prof. Wei Su](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=wei-su-weisu), and my co-supervisor is [Prof. Yanguang Zhou](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/yanguang-zhou).

Before joining HKUST, I earned my Master's degree in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (May 2023) and a Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science from Zhejiang University (June 2021). From July 2021 to June 2022, I worked as a Research Assistant in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University, mentored by [Dr. Xinghui Zhong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhongxh).

## Research
My current research centers on high-fidelity solvers for Boltzmann transport equation–based modeling of phonon heat conduction at [Dr. SU's Research Group](https://weisu-mae.github.io/). More broadly, I am interested in applied mathematics topics spanning scientific computing, high-performance computing, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification, etc.
