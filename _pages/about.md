I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (IIP), at the Division of Emerging Interdsciplinary Areas (EMIA), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My primary supervisor is [Dr. Wei Su](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=wei-su-weisu), and my co-supervisor is [Dr. Yanguang Zhou](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/yanguang-zhou).

I obtained my Master's degree in Mathematics at University of Wisconsin - Madison in May 2023, and Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science at Zhejiang University in June 2021. I've also worked as a research assistant, mentored by [Dr. Xinghui Zhong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhongxh) from July 2021 to June 2022, at School of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University.

My current research focuses on **high-fidelity solution methods for Boltzmann transport equation-based modelling of phonon heat conduction**, in [Dr. SU's Research Group](https://weisu-mae.github.io/). My general research interests lie in applied mathematics involving: scientific computing, high-performance computing, uncertainty quantification, machine learning, etc.
