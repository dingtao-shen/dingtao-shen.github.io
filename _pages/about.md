I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (IIP) at EMIA, HKUST. My primary supervisor is Dr. [Wei Su](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=wei-su-weisu), and my co-supervisor is Dr. [Yanguang Zhou](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/yanguang-zhou).

My current research focus on high-fidelity solution methods for Boltzmann transport equation-based modelling of phonon heat conduction, in [Dr. SU's Research Group](https://weisu-mae.github.io/). My general research interests lie in applied mathematics: scientific computing, high-performance computing, uncertainty quantification, machine learning, etc.
